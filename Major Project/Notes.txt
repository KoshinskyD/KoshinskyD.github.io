// Current version is broken due to scaling of the sprite with
// screen size as it somehow messed with hitbox detection more 
// than it should have in my mind.
// When I draw the hitboxes they do not colide yet it acts like 
// they do. I am not sure why this is happening however I need
// to take a break from this for a while

// 9:15/21/9/2020
// The collision still does not line up.
// I have no idea why however I found a number that works. 
// I plan to move on today and maybe add sounds
// Moved this over from the code so it has it own document and
// is not taking up space as a giant comment.

// 11:15/21/9/2020
// My issue with collision was caused by rectMode and imageMode.
// Currently collision works as intended and there are no issues 
// that I see I plan on adding Background music tomorrow. I have
// a few Ideas for what to add but have not deciced and I have
// no clue how to do it yet. I have also added a death screen.

// 9:25/22/2020
// I am going to wait on music for now as I havent found a good
// song for the background. Going to use the background 
// selection/stitching for extra for experts probably. I was
// tempted to add enemies today but I will wait as I will
// probably learn a good way to do it soon rather than just
// hacking it togeather poorly

// 10:20/22//2020
// Handed in interactive scene. My current idea for this game is
// have a set amount of enemies per area and gain power(damage,
// defense, hp) for every enemy killed. After a set amount of 
// areas/stages there will be a boss fight. this fight is always
// accesable but will be near impossible if you go there with no
// power ups.

// Mouse running in our class, fun times. Started working on 
// enemies. Also Trying to rework sprite animations as it is
// not the best now. Tried using framecount but I will probably
// switch to millis() as it seems better and there are issues 
// with how I used framecount.

// 1/10/2020
// Changed how sprites switch but I am still using framecount.

// 10:49/2/10/2020
// Creating a player class. Mostly working but I am getting
// errors with displaying my sprite.

// 11:42/2/10/2020
// Fixed errors with displaying char sprite and got enemies
// working mostly. Hitboxes are not that good but they work as a
// proof of concept and it is fun just trying to dodge them. I
// plan to add attacks for the player tonight or tomorrow and
// then an inventory for the player. I will use this inventory
// for my 2d array project.

// 10:22/5/10/2020
// Started work on inventory.

// 11:43/5/10/2020
// Mostly finished sidebar. Need to work on inventory position.
// Currently the inventory array is filled with random values to
// make it so i can display it.
// Using numbers based on a sidebar of 300 width.
