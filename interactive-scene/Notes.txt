// Current version is broken due to scaling of the sprite with
// screen size as it somehow messed with hitbox detection more 
// than it should have in my mind.
// When I draw the hitboxes they do not colide yet it acts like 
// they do. I am not sure why this is happening however I need
// to take a break from this for a while

// The collision still does not line up.
// I have no idea why however I found a number that works. 
// I plan to move on today and maybe add sounds
// Moved this over from the code so it has it own document and
// is not taking up space as a giant comment.

// My issue with collision was caused by rectMode and imageMode.
// Currently collision works as intended and there are no issues 
// that I see I plan on adding Background music tomorrow. I have
// a few Ideas for what to add but have not deciced and I have
// no clue how to do it yet. I have also added a death screen.

// 9:25/22/2020
// I am going to wait on music for now as I havent found a good
// song for the background. Going to use the background 
// selection/stitching for extra for experts probably. I was
// tempted to add enemies today but I will wait as I will
// probably learn a good way to do it soon rather than just
// hacking it togeather poorly

// Handed in interactive scene. My current idea for this game is
// have a set amount of enemies per area and gain power(damage,
// defense, hp) for every enemy killed. After a set amount of 
// areas/stages there will be a boss fight. this fight is always
// accesable but will be near impossible if you go there with no
// power ups.
